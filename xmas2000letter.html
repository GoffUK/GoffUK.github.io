<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">Well,
here we are at nearly the end of 2010, where this year has gone is
beyond me.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">I
hope this letter finds you and yours in the best of health? Jerry,
Thomas and I are a thriving, as is our family apart from that is
Jerry's Mum, who is very poorly in hospital.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">Our
last 'year in Provence' has been different, challenging and a real
experience. The weather and its extremities have kept us on our toes
and teaching us many lessons in the garden.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">We
started 2010 deciding to top our 30 odd Oak trees to improve views
and evening sunshine, an easy task we thought. The weather caught us
out on many occasions. Two large trees have been left untouched
because of their position, one on the east side in the lane to our
house, the other is on the north side and higher up on a terrace,
both of which overhang on land that is not ours, so will need to have
permission from the Mairie in the village to cut.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">Spring
arrived allowing all the bulbs I had planted on the terraces to bloom
in profusion, they certainly were a cheery sight.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">The
better weather also gave us the opportunity to have the front terrace
(on north side) re-concreted and eventually tiled, another challenge
awaited us as the wrong tiles arrived, so a wait of several weeks
before we received the right ones and eventually the project was
completed.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">For
2011 the major project will be to finish the south terrace and maybe
get the 'pool' installed. Neither project will be started until
February/March as none of the builders work outside until the weather
improves here. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">Jerry
has been kept busy, building a covered area for our new car. He also
added guttering to the front of the house, which he connected to a
large water container which we can conserve as much water as possible
from the rainfall here. This we can use in the summer for the fruit
and vegetables we grow. He has also been busy creating raised beds in
the vegetable garden, which is still under construction, we have to
get some more wood to finish.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">The
garden has provided us with vegetable and fruit, and this year the
very first olives on our young trees.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">We
discovered in the garden a 'Berger'-shepherds hut in our garden, it
had fallen down with only two walls standing, we decided to rebuilt
it using all the stones we found around it. It now has three walls
and a roof on it, we intend to raise the roof more though as to allow
water to fall better at the back, it is the perfect storage area for
all the logs we have after the tree cutting. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">Inside
the house remains very much the same, we have now painted all the
walls in the one colour of white, so much easier making it bright and
light.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">We
have had many visitors, family and friends to stay, we look forward
to all the trips to us. We have also made many trips back home to
England because of family commitments like weddings etc. We try to
see as many people as possible on our return back but just don't seem
to have enough time to see everyone.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">I
am still looking for work, not so easy here, however I do have a
'little job' with a French family teaching/helping them with their
English. They are lovely and in return they help me with my French.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">I
have joined a 'singing group' in the village of La Verdiere, I can't
sing in tune,but they haven't notice yet!!!!!. It helps me with the
pronunciation so that is why I joined, they are a friendly bunch and
have made me very welcome.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">Still
going to college and conversation classes to improve my language, it
is good for me have have a focus especially as I do not work. It is a
very social group and a way of meeting people too.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">Jerry's
job is going really well, he works later now and sometimes in the
evenings and weekends. He seems happy though which is important when
working and living overseas. Lots going on with Iter and it is moving
ahead with contracts and construction. People too are moving on, some
retiring and some as their contracts have finished so they are
returning to their own countries. It is a sad thing as you get to
know these people and before you know it they are leaving.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">Thomas
(my cat) is thriving, he is building up his winter coat. He is still
climbing trees and investigating new things, including animals, some
of which scare him more. Recently he came flying in through the front
door, something had definitely spooked him. It was not until the
following morning that we discovered what it was. Jerry and I
discovered footprints all around the garden. They belonged to a
family of 'wild boar', they had been rummaging in the garden looking
for food and in the process had dug up parts of the garden, I just
wish they had stayed longer and dug up the whole garden saving us the
job.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">Erin
our eldest and her boyfriend Tim, moved into their new home in
February,they now live in East Hagbourne. They are both happy in
their new home and slowly getting it together. I have sorted out
their garden with weeding and cutting back plants and doing the
shredding and using it to mulch the borders for them. Jerry helped
Tim to replace a concrete post and wood panel in the fencing. Tim
then painted all the panels to match it, it looks really good now. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">Helen
and her boyfriend are still living in their apartment in Abingdon,it
is a lovely big place however they are thinking about moving to a
house so they can have a garden, it won't be until next year though. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">Both
couples are as ever busy at work, but thankfully also in good health.
</FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">Jerry
and I return to England, weather permitting on Christmas Eve for the
festive season. We are looking forward to spending time with our
girls and family, and if there is time to see friends too.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">Well
I hope this letter has given you a little taster of our life here in
Provence over the last year.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">I
hope you have a Very Happy Christmas and a Peaceful New Year. May the
coming year bring you the very best of everything.</FONT></P>
